You were originally trying to store most of your information all in one hostel record
Ie, each hostel would match Stacey's original schema
That means it had review data and photo data as part of its table information

You ran into an issue where you were having trouble loading review data into the database
This was because you were storing your reviews as an array of JSON objects 
This was difficult to upload

You revised to make things truly relational
Hence this folder being outdated/unused
You're keeping it just in case you might need to reference it later
